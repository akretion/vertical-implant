========================
Sale From Hospital Stock
========================

This module eases the management of sale orders delivered from the remote stock located in the hospital.

For some (strange) reasons, hospitals expect the refill picking to carry the reference of the sale order that took the product out of the remote stock in the hospital (which make it impossible to use reordering rules to refill the remote stock of the hospital).

Installation
============

This module depends on the OCA module **sale_commercial_partner** from `OCA/sale-workflow <https://github.com/OCA/sale-workflow>`_.

It also depends on the community module **sale_order_route** from `akretion/odoo-usability <https://github.com/akretion/odoo-usability>`_.
